			h1 Games
				p.gamesPar Game design is difficult, yet fascinating. I have no pretension to be an expert on the subject, but I love turning a "what if you could do this in a game..." into a playable prototype. I mainly use Unity3D, but, I hope to find the time to trie the Unreal Engine soon.

				h2 Russian Planet
				img.russianPhoto.glitchPhoto.photoProjet(src='img/russian.png')
				p.russianPar Russian Planet is a top-down shooter inspired by games like Alien Breed or Teleglitch. It features randomly generated levels, permadeath, and a lot of alien blood. I've been working on this game on my free time for almost a year now. It's a lot more complex than the prototypes I'm used to make. You can try the last build

				p.graveyardPar Graveyard Slot was our entry, me, and three other students from Gobelins, for the 31th Ludum Dare. Over the course of one little cold winter of december, we tried to make a horror game about a kid watching TV all night long, in order to forget there's a monster in his closet... We ended #256 overall and #23 for the mood category, on a total of 1269 entries. You can try it

				h2 Luftstoner
				img.russianPhoto.glitchPhoto.photoProjet(src='img/luftstoner.png')
				p.luftPar Luftstoner is a cool little shooter I made after watching Jan Willem Nijman lecture's The Art of Screenshake. I wanted to make a simple game, yet fun, addictive, and with a very good gamefeel. So I took one of Vlambeer best game : Luftrausers, and tried to copy just what made the game so thrilling. I think I succeded, but you don't have to trust me :

				p.timbrePar Timbre is an experimental application I worked on during my first year at Gobelin's. It uses spacialized sound, images, text, and procedurally generated content to create a bond between two individuals, through technology and poetry. You can see the website of the project

				img.ltpidPhoto.glitchPhoto.photoProjet(src='img/ltsitd.png')
				p.ltpitdPar Landscapes In The Dark is an experiment in WebGL meant to reproduce visually the mood of the pieces of music contained on Coil's Musick to Play in the Dark. Coil being my favourite band, it occured to me one day that tr'nuitanscribing their universe in visual manifestations could lead to interesting, surrealistic pieces of art. This was also, for me, a way to learn Three.js. You can try my interpretation of "Are You Shivering"

				p Court-Circuit is my end of study project at Gobelin. We're two developers and three graphic designer working on it. It consists of two modules and one Ipad application. It's an unusual marble circuit, physical and virtual, meant to create a playful time between a child and one of his/her relative.
